# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**!
This repository showcases a complete SQL-based data warehousing solution—from planning and building the warehouse to generating business-ready insights. This is part of my ongoing learning journey, and I’ve designed it as a portfolio project that reflects real industry practices in both data engineering and analytics.

## 🎯Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### **Objective**

Create a modern data warehouse in SQL Server by integrating data from two different source systems to support analytics and decision-making.

#### **Specifications**

* **Data Sources:** ERP and CRM data provided as CSV files
* **Data Quality:** Clean, standardize, and fix inconsistencies before analysis
* **Integration:** Merge both sources into a well-structured, analytics-friendly data model
* **Scope:** Work only with the latest dataset (no historization required)
* **Documentation:** Provide clear, simple documentation for both business and technical users

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

#### **Objective**

Use SQL to build analytical queries and surface insights related to:

* **Customer behavior**
* **Product performance**
* **Sales trends**

These insights help stakeholders understand patterns, track performance, and support strategic decisions.

## About Me

Hi! I’m **Priya Santosh Sharma**, currently working towards becoming a strong Data Analyst / Data Scientist.
I enjoy breaking down concepts, building real-world projects, and improving my skills step by step.
This project is part of my learning roadmap where I combine SQL, data engineering fundamentals, and analytics to understand how real businesses work with data.

More updates coming soon as I refine and expand the warehouse!
